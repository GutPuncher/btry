## Usage

    $ btry
    30.6 Wh / 31.1 Wh (98%)

Sometimes there are no `energy_now` and `energy_full` files, but `charge_*` files instead
(at least on my ThinkPad X220).  If this is the case, `btry` prints ampere hours instead
of watt hours.

    $ btry
    2.2 Ah / 2.8 Ah (78%)

## Build instructions

### Linux on x86-64

    $ make

### Other platforms

No.

## Notes

When my ThinkPad is plugged in at the time I wake it from suspend mode, I get the
`charge_now` file.  When it is not plugged in I get the `energy_now` file.  At least I
think that's how it works.
